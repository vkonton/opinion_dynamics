It combines algorithmic derivations, perturbation theory, and rounding error analysis, all enlivened by historical perspective and informative quotations. The coverage of the first edition has been expanded and updated, involving numerous improvements. Two new chapters treat symmetric indefinite systems and skew-symmetric systems, and nonlinear systems and Newton's method. Twelve new sections include coverage of additional error bounds for Gaussian elimination, rank revealing LU factorizations, weighted and constrained least squares problems, and the fused multiply-add operation found on some modern computer architectures. This new edition is a suitable reference for an advanced course and can also be used at all levels as a supplementary text from which to draw examples, historical perspective, statements of results, and exercises. In addition the thorough indexes and extensive, up-to-date bibliography are in a readily accessible form.},

Applying our general algorithm, we obtain near-optimally efficient algorithms for all these mixture learning problems.},

Our algorithm achieves the information-theoretically optimal sample size (up to a constant factor), runs in polynomial time, and is robust to model misspecification with nearly-optimal error guarantees. Specifically, we give an algorithm that, on input \$n=O(1/{\textbackslash}eps{\textasciicircum}\{5/2\})\$ samples from an unknown distribution \$f\$, runs in time \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{O\}(n{\textasciicircum}\{8/5\})\$, and outputs a log-concave hypothesis \$h\$ that (with high probability) satisfies \${\textbackslash}dtv(h, f) = O({\textbackslash}opt)+{\textbackslash}eps\$, where \${\textbackslash}opt\$ is the minimum total variation distance between \$f\$ and the class of log-concave distributions. Our approach to the robust proper learning problem is quite flexible and may be applicable to many other univariate distribution families.},

	abstract = {We give a highly efficient "semi-agnostic" algorithm for learning univariate probability distributions that are well approximated by piecewise polynomial density functions. Let \$p\$ be an arbitrary distribution over an interval \$I\$ which is \${\textbackslash}tau\$-close (in total variation distance) to an unknown probability distribution \$q\$ that is defined by an unknown partition of \$I\$ into \$t\$ intervals and \$t\$ unknown degree-\$d\$ polynomials specifying \$q\$ over each of the intervals. We give an algorithm that draws \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}(t{\textbackslash}new\{(d+1)\}/{\textbackslash}eps{\textasciicircum}2)\$ samples from \$p\$, runs in time \${\textbackslash}poly(t,d,1/{\textbackslash}eps)\$, and with high probability outputs a piecewise polynomial hypothesis distribution \$h\$ that is \$(O({\textbackslash}tau)+{\textbackslash}eps)\$-close (in total variation distance) to \$p\$.

We apply this general algorithm to obtain a wide range of results for many natural problems in density estimation over both continuous and discrete domains. These include state-of-the-art results for learning mixtures of log-concave distributions; mixtures of \$t\$-modal distributions; mixtures of Monotone Hazard Rate distributions; mixtures of Poisson Binomial Distributions; mixtures of Gaussians; and mixtures of \$k\$-monotone densities. Our general technique yields computationally efficient algorithms for all these problems, in many cases with provably optimal sample complexities (up to logarithmic factors) in all parameters.},

Useful properties of univariate log-concave distributions are proven without imposing differentiability of density functions. We also discuss discrete and multivariate distributions. We propose simple non-parametric testing procedures for log-concavity. The test statistics are constructed to test one of the two implications of log-concavity: increasing hazard rate or new-is-better-than-used (NBU) property. The tests for increasing hazard rate are based on sample information of the normalized spacing of the order statistics. The tests for NBU property fall into the category of Hoeffding's U- statistics. The test procedures are illustrated with well known economic data where log-concavity is usually assumed.},

In more detail, we give an estimator that, for any $d \ge 1$ and $ε>0$, draws $\tilde{O}_d \left( (1/ε)^(d+5)/2 \right)$ samples from an unknown target log-concave density on $R^d$, and outputs a hypothesis that (with high probability) is $ε$-close to the target, in total variation distance.

Moreover, for all cases considered, our algorithm has near-optimal sample complexity with regard to the domain size and is computationally efficient. For most of these classes, we provide the first non-trivial tester in the literature. In addition, we also describe a generic method to prove lower bounds for this problem, and use it to show our upper bounds are nearly tight. Finally, we extend some of our techniques to tolerant testing, deriving nearly--tight upper and lower bounds for the corresponding questions.",

	title = {An {Introduction} to {Stein}'s {Method}},
	abstract = {A common theme in probability theory is the approximation of complicated probability distributions by simpler ones, the central limit theorem being a classical example. Stein's method is a tool which makes this possible in a wide variety of situations. Traditional approaches, for example using Fourier analysis, become awkward to carry through in situations in which dependence plays an important part, whereas Stein's method can often still be applied to great effect. In addition, the method delivers estimates for the error in the approximation, and not just a proof of convergence. Nor is there in principle any restriction on the distribution to be approximated; it can equally well be normal, or Poisson, or that of the whole path of a random process, though the techniques have so far been worked out in much more detail for the classical approximation theorems. This volume of lecture notes provides a detailed introduction to the theory and application of Stein's method, in a form suitable for graduate students who want to acquaint themselves with the method. It includes chapters treating normal, Poisson and compound Poisson approximation, approximation by Poisson processes, and approximation by an arbitrary distribution, written by experts in the different fields. The lectures take the reader from the very basics of Stein's method to the limits of current knowledge.

	title = {Settling the {Polynomial} {Learnability} of {Mixtures} of {Gaussians}},
	abstract = {Given data drawn from a mixture of multivariate Gaussians, a basic problem is to accurately estimate the mixture parameters. We give an algorithm for this problem that has a running time, and data requirement polynomial in the dimension and the inverse of the desired accuracy, with provably minimal assumptions on the Gaussians. As simple consequences of our learning algorithm, we can perform near-optimal clustering of the sample points and density estimation for mixtures of k Gaussians, efficiently. The building blocks of our algorithm are based on the work Kalai et al. [STOC 2010] that gives an efficient algorithm for learning mixtures of two Gaussians by considering a series of projections down to one dimension, and applying the method of moments to each univariate projection. A major technical hurdle in Kalai et al. is showing that one can efficiently learn univariate mixtures of two Gaussians. In contrast, because pathological scenarios can arise when considering univariate projections of mixtures of more than two Gaussians, the bulk of the work in this paper concerns how to leverage an algorithm for learning univariate mixtures (of many Gaussians) to yield an efficient algorithm for learning in high dimensions. Our algorithm employs hierarchical clustering and rescaling, together with delicate methods for backtracking and recovering from failures that can occur in our univariate algorithm. Finally, while the running time and data requirements of our algorithm depend exponentially on the number of Gaussians in the mixture, we prove that such a dependence is necessary.},
