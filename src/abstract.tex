We study opinion formation games based on the famous model proposed by Friedkin
and Johsen. In today's huge social networks the assumption that in each round
agents update their opinions by taking into account the opinions of \emph{all}
their friends is unrealistic. So, we are interested in the convergence
properties of simple and natural variants of the FJ model that use limited
information exchange in each round and converge to the same stable point.
%
As in the FJ model, we assume that each agent $i$ has an intrinsic opinion $s_i
\in [0,1]$ and maintains an expressed opinion $x_i(t) \in [0,1]$ in each round
$t$. To model limited information exchange, we consider an opinion formation
process where each agent $i$ meets with  one random friend $j$ in each round
$t$ and learns only her current opinion $x_j(t)$. The amount of influence $j$
imposes on $i$ is reflected by the probability $p_{ij}$ with which $i$ meets
$j$. Then, agent $i$ suffers a disagreement cost that is a convex combination
of $(x_i(t) - s_i)^2$ and $(x_i(t) - x_j(t))^2$.
%
For this variant of the FJ model, we show that the agents can adopt a simple
opinion update rule that ensures no regret to the experienced
disagreement cost and results in an opinion vector that converges to the
equilibrium point $x^\ast$ of the FJ model within distance $\eps$ in
$\mrm{poly}(\log n /\eps)$ rounds.
%
The convergence time is exponentially slower than the convergence time of the
FJ model in the full information setting. So, a natural question is whether
there exists no regret dynamics with improved convergence rate. We show that any
dynamics that guarantees vanishing regret against the experienced disagreement
cost requires $\Omega(1/\eps)$ rounds to be within distance $\eps$ from
$x^{\ast}$. We prove this result through a connection to learning a Bernoulli distribution, 
which indicates that no-regret dynamics suffer low convergence rates due to their inability to
exploit information about the influence weights associated with
probabilities $p_{ij}$. Finally, we present an opinion update rule that 
uses the influence weights and converges to $x^\ast$ in
$\tilde{O}(\log n \log^2(1/\eps))$ rounds, thus providing evidence that absence of knowledge
about the influence weights in each agent's social neighborhood impacts the convergence rate more
than absence of knowledge about the opinions in it.
