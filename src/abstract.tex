We study opinion formation games based on the famous model proposed by Friedkin
and Johsen.  In today's huge social networks the assumption that in each round
all agents update their opinions by taking into account the opinions of
\emph{all} their friends could be unrealistic. Therefore, we assume that in
each round each agent gets to meet with only one random friend of
hers.  Since it is more likely to meet some friends than others we assume
that agent $i$ meets agent $j$ with probability $p_{ij}$.
Specifically, we define an opinion formation game, where at round $t$,
agent $i$ with intrinsic opinion $s_i\in[0,1]$ and expressed opinion $x_i(t)
\in[0,1]$ meets with probability $p_{ij}$ neighbor $j$ with opinion $x_j(t)$
and suffers cost that is a convex combination of $(x_i(t) - s_i)^2$ and
$(x_i(t) - x_j(t))^2$.

For a dynamics in the above setting to be considered as natural it must be
simple, converge to the equilibrium $x^*$, and perhaps most importantly, it
must be a reasonable choice for selfish agents.  In this work we show that
\emph{fictitious play}, is a natural dynamics for the above game.  We prove
that, after $O(1/\eps^2)$ rounds, the opinion vector is within error $\eps$  of
the equilibrium. Moreover, we show that fictitious play admits no-regret and
thus, is a reasonable algorithm for agents to implement.

The classical Friedkin-Johsen dynamics converges to the equilibrium within
error $\eps$ after only $O(\log(1/\eps))$ rounds whereas in our setting
fictitious play needs $\widetilde{O}(1/\eps^2)$ rounds. A natural question is
whether there exists a simple dynamics for our problem with better rate of
convergence.  We answer this question in the negative by showing that
no-regret algorithms cannot converge with less than $\mrm{poly}(1/\eps)$ rounds.
Interestingly, we show that when agents meet a neighbor \emph{uniformly}
at random, there exists a dynamics that only needs $O(\log(1/\eps)^2)$ rounds,
resembling the convergence rate of the original Friedkin-Johsen model.
