\section{Lower bound for unbiased estimators}

We first state a well known result from point estimation:
\begin{lemma}[Cramer-Rao bound]Let $\hat{\theta}$ be an estimator for the parameter $\theta$ of a distribution $P_\theta$, where $\theta$ is a continuous parameter. Suppose that the estimator is unbiased, that is:$E[\hat{\theta}] = 0$, for all distributions $P_\theta$. Under suitable regularity conditions, which are met by bernoulli distributions, it holds:$$Var[\hat{\theta}] \geq  \frac{1}{nI_\theta}$$, where $I_\theta$ is the Fischer information of distribution $P_\theta$.
\end{lemma}

In the case of Bernoulli random variables, we can easily show that for a Bernoulli with probability $\theta$, $I_\theta = \frac{1}{\theta(1-\theta)} $. Applying the above result we obtain $$ var[\hat{\theta}] \geq \frac{\theta(1-\theta) }{n}\geq \frac{1}{4n} $$ for every unbiased estimator $\hat{\theta}$. We can use this fact to show that a specific class of distributed protocols that solve our problem has "large" variance. Let $P$ be a protocol that when restricted to the star topology acts like an unbiased estimator for the weighted mean value of the neighbours, which can be an arbitrary real number in $[0,1]$. We will show that for all star topologies the variance of the solution is $\geq \frac{(1-a)^2}{4n}$ after $n$ samples. Suppose that for a specific star topology the preceding claim doesn't hold. Then, we notice that if $\hat{\theta}$ is the output of the protocol is this topology, then $\frac{(\hat{\theta}-as)}{1-a}$ is an unbiased estimator of the mean value of the neighbours, and this holds for every possible value of the mean. By our hypothesis, we have:
$$Var[\frac{\hat{\theta}-as}{1-a}] = \frac{1}{(1-a)^2}Var[\hat{\theta}] < \frac{1}{4n}$$, a contradiction, since our constructed estimator is unbiased.
