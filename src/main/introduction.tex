\section{Introduction}
The formation and dynamics of opinions are an important aspect in modern
society and have been studied extensively for decades (see e.g., \cite{Jackson}).
Opinion formation is based on information exchange, between socially
connected people (e.g., family, friends, colleagues) who interact often
and affect each other's opinion. Moreover, opinion
formation is often \emph{dynamic} in the sense that discussions and
interactions lead to changes in the expressed opinions. With the
advent of the internet and social media the dynamic aspects of
opinion formation have become ever more dominant. To capture opinion formation
on a formal level, several models have been proposed
(see e.g., \cite{DeGroot,FJ90,HK,BKO11,GS14,BGM13} for
continuous opinions and \cite{FGV12,YOASS13,BFM16} for discrete ones).
A common assumption, that dates back to DeGroot \cite{DeGroot}, is
that opinions evolve through a form of repeated averaging of
information collected from the agent social neighborhoods.

Our work builds on the influential model for opinion formation
proposed by Friedkin and Johnsen \cite{FJ90}.
The FJ-model is a variation on the DeGroot model 
that captures the fact consensus on the opinions
of a social group is not generally reached.  
According to FJ-model there exists a set of $n$ agents.
Each agent $i$ holds an
internal opinion $s_i\in [0,1]$, which is private and
invariant over time and a public opinion $x_i \in [0,1]$
Initially, agents start with their internal opinion and at
each round $t\geq1$, update their public opinion
$x_i(t)$ to a weighted average of public opinion of
their social neighbors and their internal opinion, i.e.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:FJ_model}
  x_i(t)= \frac{\sum_{j\neq i}w_{ij}x_j(t-1)
    + w_{ii}s_i}{\sum_{j\neq i}w_{ij}+w_{ii}}
\end{equation}
%
where the weights $w_{ij}$ quantify the influence between
the agents and $w_{ii}$ the self confidence of the agents
towards their internal belief. 

The FJ-model is one of most influential models for opinion formation.
Its has a very simple update rule, consisting it a plausible choice
for modeling natural behavior and 
its basic assumptions are aligned with empirical 
findings on the way political orientation is formed \cite{AFH05,K47}.
At the same time, it admits a unique equilibrium point 
$x^* \in [0,1]^n$ to which it converges exponentially fast \cite{GS14}.

The FJ-model has also been studied under a game theoretic
view point. Bindel et al. considered its update rule
as the minimizer of a quadradic disagreement cost function
and based on it they defined the following one shot
opinion formation game \cite{BKO11}. The strategy of each agent $i$ is
her public opinion $x_i$, incuring her a
disagreement cost
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:BKO_cost}
  C_i(x_i,x_{-i})=
  \sum_{j \neq i}w_{ij} (x_i-x_j)^2 + w_{ii}(x_i-s_i)^2
\end{equation}
%
Note that the the FJ-model is the \emph{simultaneous best response dynamics} 
in the repeated version of this one shot game. In \cite{BKO11}
they quantified the inefficiency of the equilibrium $x^*$ with 
respect to the total disagreement cost. Namely, the Price of Anarchy 
is less than $9/8$ in case $w_{ij}=w_{ji}$.
We remark that their work also introduced an alternative
framework for studying the dynamics of opinions.
Instead of modeling the way opinions evolve
by precise dynamical processes, agents can be considered to repeatedly
play a suitable one shot opinion formation game and update their 
opinions so as to minimize their individual disagreement cost. 
This framework is much more fruitful since 
different angles of the opinion formation process can be easily 
captured by suitable one shot games e.g. in \cite{BGM13,EFHS17} 
variants of the above opinion formation game are introduced.
This framework also permits that the agents 
update their opinions in more abstract ways than
a specific update rule of a precise dynamical process.
For example in the above repeated game, agents instead of
adopting \emph{best response}, could update their opinions according
to a \emph{no-regret} learning algorithm.

\subsection{Motivation}

As already mentioned FJ-model is one of the most 
well accepted models. The equilibrium point $x^*$ is 
generally considered as a good estimation about the 
opinions formed in a social network and many recent 
algorithmic problems concerning the influence of opinions 
(for product advertising, influencing political views e.t.c.) 
are defined with respect to it \cite{GTT13,AKPT18}. 
Our work is motivated by the fact that the FJ-model
implies a large amount of information exchange
between the agents. At each round its update rule requires 
that every agent learns all the opinions of her social neighbors.
In todays's large social networks each user
may have several hundrends of friends and obviously
she cannot learn all these opinions each day.
In such enviroments it is far more reasonable to assume
that individuals randomly meet a small subset of their 
acquitances and these are the only opinions that the learn.
Such information exchange constraints consist the FJ-model
unsuitable for modeling the opinion formation process
in such large networks. The latter introduces some skeptisism 
on how well the equilibrium point $x^*$ resembles the 
limiting behavior of the opinions. 
Our work is motivated by the following 
questions.

\begin{question}
Does the equilibrium point $x^*$ tell anything about 
the final opinions in large social networks?
Are there simple update rules that require limited information
exchange and lead the opinions to $x^*$? Can these update rules be 
justified as natural behavior for selfish
agents under a game-theoretic solution concept?
\end{question}

To model the fact that in large networks, agents 
meet a small random subset of their friends each day, 
we consider an imperfect-information version of the 
opinion formation game defined in \cite{BKO11}. In equation~(\ref{eq:BKO_cost}) the 
coefficient $w_{ij}$ measures the influence that $j$ poses on $i$. 
Following the common belief that \enquote{we are influenced more by
those we interact more often}, $w_{ij}$ can be interpreted as 
a measure on how frequently $i$ meets $j$. In our  imperfect-infomation
version, each agent $i$ randomly meets an agent $j$ 
(with respect to her weights) and experiences disagreement cost
based on the distance of their opinions and on how susceptible is $i$
on her internal opinion. More formally, we consider the
following one shot game.
\begin{definition}\label{d:random_game}
  For a given opinion vector $x \in [0,1]^n$, the disagreement cost of agent $i$
  is the random variable $C_i(x_i,x_{-i})$ defined as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $i$ meets one of her neighbors $j$ with probability
      $p_{ij}= w_{ij}/\sum_{j\in N_i}w_{ij}$
    \item suffers cost $C_i(x_i , x_{-i}) = (1-a_i)(x_i-x_j)^2 + a_i(x_i-s_i)^2$,
      where $\alpha_i = w_i/(\sum_{j\in N_i}w_{ij}+w_i)$
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\noindent The main difference of the original opinion formation game in \cite{BKO11} 
and our variant is that in the first case an opinion vector $x\in [0,1]^n$ defines
\emph{deterministically} the cost $C_i(x)$ of each agent $i$,
whereas in the second it defines a probability distribution on the cost
$C_i(x)$ that $i$ suffers. Notice that the expected 
disagreement cost of each agent $i$ (scaled by the constant $\sum_{j\neq i}w_{ij}+w_{ii}$)
is the same as the disagreement cost defined in equation~(\ref{eq:BKO_cost}).
As a result, the Nash equilibrium with respect to the expected cost of the agents,
is the equilibrium point $x^*$.

In order to model the opinion formation process in limited information 
exchange enviroments, we consider that the agents to be engaged in the 
above one-shot game. At round $t$, each agent $i$ selects an opinion 
$x_i(t)$ and suffers a disagreement cost based on the opinion 
of the neighbor that she randomly met. At the end of the round she is 
informed only about the opinion of this neighbor and may use this infomation
to update her opinion. The reduction in information exchange is evident:
At each round each agent learns the opinion of \emph{just one} of her neighbors.
Our work deals with the following questions:
\begin{question}
Can the agents update their opinions according to the
limited infomation that they receive such that
$1$) the total disagreement cost that they experience is in a
sense minimized, $2)$ the produced opinion vector $x(t)$ convergences
fast to the equilibrium $x^*$?
\end{question}

\subsection{Contribution}
We introduce a simple and intuitive update rule that if the agents adopt,
the resulting opinion vector $x(t)$ converges to $x^*$.
Our update rule is a \emph{Follow the Leader algorithm}
meaning that at round $t$, each agent updates her opinion
to the minimizer of total disagreement cost that
she experienced until $t-1$. It also admits a very simple form,
it is just the time average of the opinions that the agent observes.
In section~\ref{s:fictitious_convergence},
we bound its convergence time and we show that in order
to acheive $\eps$ distance from $x^*$, poly($1/\eps$) rounds
are needed. In section~\ref{s:fictitious_noregret},
we show that this rule ensures \emph{no-regret} to any agent
that adopts it. Namely, the average disagreement cost (that
the agent experiences) per round approaches that
of expressing the best opinion in hindsight. The latter
makes our algorithm a natural behavioral assumption for
agents that selfishly want to minize their incured disagreement cost.
Our results imply that even if agents are subjected to  
information exchange constraints, there exists natural 
dynamics that converge to equilibrium $x^*$, consisting it 
a robust choice for modeling the limiting behavior of the opinions.

In section~\ref{s:lower_bound}, we show
that for any update rule that ensures \emph{no-regret}
to the agents, the resulting opinion vector $x(t)$
cannot converge to $x^*$ faster than polynomially. 
We use an information theoretic argument to prove
the latter for a larger class of update rules,
\emph{opinion dependent update rules}. This class includes
all the update rules that only depend on the observed
opinions. Interestingly polynomial convergence is not a 
generic property our limited information exchange setting.
In Section~\ref{s:cc_convergence}, we present an update rule 
that depends on the observed opinions but also on the weights
$w_{ij}$ and converges exponentially fast to $x^*$. Our results
provide a clear and intuitive characterization on the update 
rules that can acheive exponential convergence and serve as 
an \enquote{algorithmic guide} for future limited information exchange
variants of the FJ-model. Moreover they indicate the fundamental reason that
the FJ-model converges exponential fast and this has little
to do with the \enquote{large} information exchange 
that it requires and much more to do with the fact that 
the it uses the values of the weights $w_{ij}$.

\subsection{Related Work}
Apart from the forementioned results there exists a large amount
of literature concerning the FJ-model.
Many recent works \cite{BGM13,CKO13,BFM16,EFHS17} bound the
inefficiency of equilibrium in variants of opinion formation game
defined in \cite{BKO11}. In \cite{GS14} they bound that the convergence
time of the FJ-model in in special graph topologies.
In \cite{BFM16}, a variant of the opinion formation game in which social
relations depend on the expressed opinions, is studied.
They prove that, the discretized version of the above game admits
a potential function and thus best-response converges to the
Nash equilibrium. Convergence results in other discretized variants of
the FJ-model can be found in \cite{YOASS13,FGV16}. In \cite{FPS16} the convergence
properties of limited information variants of the Heglesmann-Krause model \cite{HK}
and the FJ model, are examined.


Other works, that relate to ours, concern the convergence
properties of dynamics based on no-regret learning algorithms.
In \cite{FV97,FS99,SA00,SALS15} it is proved that in a finite $n$-person
game if each agent updates her mixed strategy according to a no-regret
algorithm the resulting \emph{time-averaged} strategy vector converges to
Coarse Correlated Equilibrium. The convergence properties of no-regret dynamics
for games with infinite strategy spaces were considered in \cite{EMN09}.
They proved that for a large class of games with concave utility function
(socially concave games), the time-averaged strategy vector converges to
the PNE. More recent work investigate a stronger notion of convergence of
no-regret dynamics. In \cite{CHM17} they show that,
in $n$-person finite generic games that admit unique Nash equilibrium,
the strategy vector converges \emph{locally} and exponentially fast
to it. They also provide conditions for \emph{global} convergence.
Our results fit in this line of research since we show that
for a game with \emph{infinite} strategy space, the strategy vector
(and not the time-averaged) converges to the unique Nash equilibrium.

No-regret dynamics under limited information are also examined
in other settings. In Kleinberg et al. in \cite{KPT09} treated
load-balancing in distributed systems as
a repeated game and analyzed the convergence properties
no-regret online algorithms under the \emph{full information assumption}
that each agent learns the load of every machine.
In a subsequent work \cite{KPT11}, the same authors consider the
same problem in a \emph{limited information setting} (\enquote{bulletin board model})
in which each agent learns the load of just the machine
that served him. In \cite{HCM17,MS17} they examine the convergence
properties of online learnig algorithms in case the payoffs oberved
by the agents are contaminated with some random noise.





% As is it also mentioned in \cite{CHM17} this stronger notion
% of convergence cannot be derived from the Coarse Correlated convergence
% results stated above.
