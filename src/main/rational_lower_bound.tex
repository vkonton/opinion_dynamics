\section{Rational Lower Bound}
% In this section we prove that the following Theorem

% \begin{theorem}
%   Let $\theta_t: \{0,1\}^t \to [0,1]$ be a sequence of estimators for
%   the success probability $p$ of a Bernoulli random variable with
%   distribution $P$.
%   Let
%   \[
%     A =
%     \{
%     p \in [0,1]\ :\ \lim_{t\to \infty}
%     t^2\ \Expnew{X \sim P^t}{\lp| \theta_t(X) - p \rp|} < 1/2
%     \}.
%   \]
%   Then $\mu(A) = 0$.
% \end{theorem}
% \begin{proof}
%   In the following, we work in the measure space
%   $(\R, \mcal{M}, \mu)$, where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure,
%   and $\mcal{M}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of the Lebesgue measurable
%   sets.
%   We first show that our set $A$ is measurable.
%   Let \(R_t(p) = t^2\ \Expnew{X \sim P^t}{| \theta_t(X) - p|}\).
%   We have that $R_t: [0,1] \to [0, +\infty) $ is polynomial of
%   degree $t$ in $p$ and therefore it is a measurable function.
%   Moreover, \(\lim_{t \to \infty} R_t(p) \) is a measurable function
%   as the limit of measurable functions. Thus, $A$ is a measurable set.
%   Notice that,
%   \[
%     A \subseteq \bigcup_{t=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} A_k,
%   \]
%   where \( A_k = \{ p\in[0,1]\ :\ R_k(p) < 1/2 \} \).
%   We now show that
%   \[ A_k \subseteq B_k \coloneqq \{ p \in [0,1]\ : \
%     k^2 \min_{0 \leq i \leq k} \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp| < 1 \}.
%   \]
%   We prove this by contradiction. Suppose that $p \in A_k$ but
%   $p \notin B_k$. Since $p \in A_k$ we have that
%   \begin{align*}
%     R_k(p)
%     =
%     k^2 \sum_{i=0}^k \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp| p^i (1-p)^{k-i}
%     \geq
%     k^2 \min_{0 \leq i \leq k} \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp|
%     \sum_{i=0}^k p^i (1-p)^{k-i}
%     \geq 1.
%   \end{align*}
%   Since the functions $p \mapsto k^2 \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp|$ are
%   measurable, their pointwise minimum is measurable and therefore
%   the sets $B_k$ are also measurable.  We next proceed to bound
%   $\mu(B_k)$. Since $\theta_k$ can only take $k$ different values
%   we have that there exist $k+1$ intervals $(a_{k_i}, b_{k_i})$
%   of length at most $2/t^2$ such that
%   \(
%     B_k = \bigcup_{i=0}^k \lp(a_{k_i}, b_{k_i} \rp).
%   \)
%   Since $\mu$ is subadditive we have
%   \[
%     \mu(B_k) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k} \frac{2}{k^2} = \frac{2 (k+1)}{k^2}.  \]
%   Now observe that
%   \begin{align*}
%     \mu(A)
%     \leq \mu \lp( \bigcup_{t=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} A_k \rp)
%     \leq \mu \lp( \bigcup_{t=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} B_k \rp)
%     \leq \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \mu\lp(\bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} B_k \rp)
%     \leq \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \lim_{k \to \infty} \mu(B_k)
%     = 0
%   \end{align*}

% \end{proof}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\theta_t: \{0,1\}^t \to [0,1]$ be a sequence of estimators for
  the success probability $p$ of a Bernoulli random variable with
  distribution $P$.
  There exists $p \in [0,1]$ such that
  \[
   \lim_{t\to \infty} t^2\ \Expnew{X \sim P^t}{\lp| \theta_t(X) - p \rp|} > 0.
  \]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Observe that $\theta_t(\{0,1\}^t)$ has cardinality at most $2^t$.
  Since
  \[
    \sum_{0 \leq i \leq t} \sum_{\norm{1}{x} = i}
    \lp| \theta_t(x) - p \rp| p^i (1-p)^{t-i}
    \geq
    \sum_{0 \leq i \leq t} \binom{t}{i} \lp|
     \frac{\sum_{\norm{1}{x} = i} \theta_t(x)}{\binom{t}{i}}  - p \rp|
    p^i (1-p)^{t-i}.
  \]
  Thus, without loss of generality we assume that
  $\theta_t(\{0,1\}^t)$ contains at most $t+1$ discrete
  points.

  In the following, we work in the measure space
  $(\R, \mcal{M}, \mu)$, where $\mu$ is the Lebesgue measure,
  and $\mcal{M}$ is the $\sigma$-algebra of the Lebesgue measurable
  sets.
  Suppose that there exists no such $p \in [0,1]$.
  Let
  \[
    A =
    \{
    p \in [0,1]\ :\ \lim_{t\to \infty}
    t^2\ \Expnew{X \sim P^t}{\lp| \theta_t(X) - p \rp|} = 0
    \}.
  \]
  Then $A = [0,1]$ and $A$ is measurable as an interval.
  Notice that,
  \[
    A \subseteq \bigcup_{t=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} A_k,
  \]
  where \( A_k = \{ p\in[0,1]\ :\ R_k(p) < 1/2 \} \),
  and \(R_k(p) = k^2\ \Expnew{X \sim P^k}{| \theta_k(X) - p|}\).
  We have that $R_k: [0,1] \to [0, +\infty) $ is polynomial of
  degree $t$ in $p$ and therefore it is a measurable function.
  Thus, $A_k$ is measurable.
  We now show that
  \[ A_k \subseteq B_k \coloneqq \{ p \in [0,1]\ : \
    k^2 \min_{0 \leq i \leq k} \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp| < 1 \}.
  \]
  We prove this by contradiction. Suppose that $p \in A_k$ but
  $p \notin B_k$. Since $p \in A_k$ we have that
  \begin{align*}
    R_k(p)
    =
    k^2 \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{k}{i} \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp| p^i (1-p)^{k-i}
    \geq
    k^2 \min_{0 \leq i \leq k} \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp|
    \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{k}{i} p^i (1-p)^{k-i}
    \geq 1.
  \end{align*}
  Since the functions $p \mapsto k^2 \lp| \theta_k(i) - p \rp|$ are
  measurable, their pointwise minimum is measurable and therefore
  the sets $B_k$ are also measurable.  We next proceed to bound
  $\mu(B_k)$. Since $\theta_k$ can only take $k$ different values
  we have that there exist $k+1$ intervals $(a_{k_i}, b_{k_i})$
  of length at most $2/k^2$ such that
  \(
    B_k = \bigcup_{i=0}^k \lp(a_{k_i}, b_{k_i} \rp).
  \)
  Since $\mu$ is subadditive we have
  \[
    \mu(B_k) \leq \sum_{i=0}^{k} \frac{2}{k^2} = \frac{2 (k+1)}{k^2}.  \]
  Now observe that
  \begin{align*}
    \mu(A)
    \leq \mu \lp( \bigcup_{t=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} A_k \rp)
    \leq \mu \lp( \bigcup_{t=1}^{\infty} \bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} B_k \rp)
    \leq \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \mu\lp(\bigcap_{k=t}^{\infty} B_k \rp)
    \leq \sum_{t = 1}^{\infty} \lim_{k \to \infty} \mu(B_k)
    = 0
  \end{align*}
  Which is a contradiction since we assumed $A = [0,1]$.
\end{proof}
