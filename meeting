1. Definition 4: how big is this class.  Why is this class non trivial and important.
2. OK small round complexity.
3. Nash equilibrium of definition 1.
4. Mathematical definition of everything.
5. Pointwise convergence and no regret.
6. Opinion Dependent vs no regret.
7. question 3 should be better placed.
8. Definition 2.
9. exponential and polynomial convergence.
10. No repeated game and one shot game, say dynamics of the game.
11. No regret is opinion dependent, No regret is independent of the choices of
the agents.
