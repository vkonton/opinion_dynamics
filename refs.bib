  abstract="We analyze the performance of protocols for load balancing in distributed systems based on no-regret algorithms from online learning theory. These protocols treat load balancing as a repeated game and apply algorithms whose average performance over time is guaranteed to match or exceed the average performance of the best strategy in hindsight. Our approach captures two major aspects of distributed systems. First, in our setting of atomic load balancing, every single process can have a significant impact on the performance and behavior of the system. Furthermore, although in distributed systems participants can query the current state of the system they cannot reliably predict the effect of their actions on it. We address this issue by considering load balancing games in the bulletin board model, where players can find out the delay on all machines, but do not have information on what their experienced delay would have been if they had selected another machine. We show that under these more realistic assumptions, if all players use the well-known multiplicative weights algorithm, then the quality of the resulting solution is exponentially better than the worst correlated equilibrium, and almost as good as that of the worst Nash. These tighter bounds are derived from analyzing the dynamics of a multi-agent learning system.",

We show that these games always admit an ordinal potential, and so, pure Nash equilibria, and we design a polynomial time algorithm for computing the set of all pure Nash equilibria and the set of all social optima of a given game. We also derive non-tight upper and lower bounds on the price of anarchy and stability which only depend on the players' stubbornness, that is, on the scaling factor used to counterbalance the cost that a player incurs for disagreeing with the society and the cost she incurs for disagreeing with her innate believes.",

abstract="In an online convex optimization problem a decision-maker makes a sequence of decisions, i.e., chooses a sequence of points in Euclidean space, from a fixed feasible set. After each point is chosen, it encounters a sequence of (possibly unrelated) convex cost functions. Zinkevich (ICML 2003) introduced this framework, which models many natural repeated decision-making problems and generalizes many existing problems such as Prediction from Expert Advice and Cover's Universal Portfolios. Zinkevich showed that a simple online gradient descent algorithm achieves additive regret                                                                                                  {\$}O({\backslash}sqrt{\{}T{\}}){\$}                , for an arbitrary sequence of T convex cost functions (of bounded gradients), with respect to the best single decision in hindsight.",
