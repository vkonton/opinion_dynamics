1.v page 6 top broken reference.
2.v Theorem 1 it is log^(3/2) instead of log^2.
3. fictitious play -> FTL dynamics everywhere in the paper remove fictitious play.
4. Neighborhood N_i in sums instead of i \neq j. Fix notation of FJ model before equation 1 in introduction.
5.v reptheorem 1 in appendix of fictitious convergence.
6.v get the paper to be 14 pages with the refs, strict.
7. Fix Remark 1, in lower bound section.
8.v In Algorithm 2 d_i = |N_i|.
9.v Remove Algorithm from algorithmic.
10. Lemma 8 should be in the same form as Theorem 1. For any instance (P,s,a) etc.
11.v Use Replemma for Lemmas 10,11. Should be 3,4.
12. Delete Theorem 8.
13. Write in lower bound main text, that in Appendix we have a rigorous measure theoretic proof (measurability of sets etc.)
14. Change Title.
