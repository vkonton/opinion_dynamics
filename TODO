1.v OK page 6 top broken reference.
2.v OK Theorem 1 it is log^(3/2) instead of log^2.
3.s fictitious play -> FTL dynamics everywhere in the paper remove fictitious play.
4.s Neighborhood N_i in sums instead of i \neq j. Fix notation of FJ model before equation 1 in introduction.
5.v OK reptheorem 1 in appendix of fictitious convergence.

8.v OK In Algorithm 2 d_i = |N_i|.
9.v Remove Algorithm from algorithmic.
10.s Lemma 8 should be in the same form as Theorem 1. For any instance (P,s,a) etc.
11.v Use Replemma for Lemmas 10,11. Should be 3,4.
